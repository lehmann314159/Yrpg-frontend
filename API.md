---

### Exploration Tools

#### `look`

Examine the current room. Returns exits, monsters, items, and discovered traps.

**Arguments:** None

**Example:**
```json
{ "name": "look", "arguments": {} }
```

---

#### `move`

Move the party in a direction. Triggers the room entry sequence on first visit: trap detection, sneak check, combat initiation.

**Arguments:**

1. **Trap detection** - Party attempts to spot room traps. Thieves get a detection bonus.
2. **Undetected traps trigger** on the point character (first alive in formation).
3. **Sneak check** - If monsters are present and the party has a thief, a stealth roll is made. Success gives the thief a hidden advantage in combat.
4. **Combat begins** if enemies are present.

**Errors:**
- No exit in that direction
- Monsters blocking the path (must defeat them first)
- Currently in combat

---

#### `take`

| `item_id` | string | Yes | ID of the item to equip |

**Notes:**

- Equipping replaces the current item of that slot (old item returns to inventory)
- Items with `classRestriction` can only be equipped by listed classes

---

#### `use_item`

Use a consumable or scroll from a character's inventory.

- **Success:** Effect applied. Magic users permanently learn the spell.
- **Failure (miss by < 5):** Scroll consumed, no effect.
- **Critical failure (miss by >= 5):** Backfire — damage scrolls hurt the caster.

| fighter | -2 |

|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `character_id` | string | Yes | ID of the character attempting |

- Thieves get +6 bonus
- Success: trap disarmed permanently
- Failure: trap triggers on the disarmer

---

#### `sneak`

Thief scouts an adjacent room without entering. Reveals enemies, traps, and items on success.

**Arguments:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `character_id` | string | Yes | ID of the thief character |
| `direction` | string | Yes | Direction to scout: `north`, `south`, `east`, `west` |

#### `scout_ahead`

|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `character_id` | string | Yes | ID of the thief character |

**On sneak success:**
1. Only the thief moves to the target room (party stays behind)
2. Traps are checked using solo detection (thief only)
3. Scout combat begins: thief is hidden with initiative 100, monsters are frozen
4. Thief gets a surprise round with **double movement** (8 cells instead of 4)
5. After acting, the thief must choose `signal_party` or `combat_retreat`

**On sneak failure:**
- Entire party enters the room and normal combat begins (no surprise round)

- No exit in that direction
- No enemies in target room (use `move` instead)
- Currently in combat
- Monsters in current room

**Rest Mechanics:**
- Heals each alive character for ~33% of their MaxHP
- Recharges all spell slots for magic users
- Ambush chance: 30% + 2% per room depth, halved if a thief is alive to stand watch
- Ambush spawns 1-3 monsters scaled to depth; monsters get a surprise round if no thief is on watch

---

### Combat Tools

All combat tools require an active combat encounter. Each character gets one move and one action per turn. Turn order follows initiative.

#### `combat_status`

View combat grid, positions, initiative order, and HP.

**Arguments:** None

---

- Fighters and magic users: 2 cells. Thieves: 4 cells.
- Cannot move to occupied or blocked cells
- One move per turn

---

#### `combat_attack`

Attack a target. Melee requires adjacency; ranged requires an equipped ranged weapon and target within range.

**Arguments:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `character_id` | string | Yes | ID of the attacking character |
| `target_id` | string | Yes | ID of the enemy combatant to attack |

**Notes:**

- Adjacency uses Chebyshev distance (diagonals count as 1)
- Creates mutual engagement on melee hit
- Attacking breaks hidden status (even on miss)

---

#### `combat_use_item`

Use an item or scroll during combat. Consumes the character's action.

**Arguments:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|

**Arguments:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `character_id` | string | Yes | ID of the defending character |

---

#### `combat_hide`

**Arguments:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `character_id` | string | Yes | ID of the thief attempting to hide |

**Notes:**
- Only thieves can hide

- Success: hidden (monsters can't target, next attack has advantage)

---

#### `combat_retreat`

Attempt to flee combat. Triggers opportunity attacks from engaged enemies.

**Arguments:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `character_id` | string | Yes | ID of the character retreating |

**Mechanics:**
1. If engaged, the engaged enemy gets a free opportunity attack
2. Roll d20 + DEX/2 vs DC 12. Thieves get +4 bonus.
3. Success: character is removed from the grid
4. If all living party members retreat, the party flees to the previous room

**Scout phase retreat:** During the scout decision phase, `combat_retreat` works differently:
- **Not engaged:** Automatic success. Thief returns to the previous room, combat ends.
- **Engaged:** Standard retreat roll. On success: thief returns, combat ends. On failure: party is automatically signaled and joins combat.

---

#### `signal_party`

After a successful `scout_ahead` surprise round, signal the rest of the party to join combat. Only usable during the scout decision phase.

**Arguments:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |

**Mechanics:**
1. All party members move to the scout's room

- Character is not the scout

#### `end_turn`

---

## Combat Mechanics

### Turn Structure
1. Initiative: d20 + DEX/2 + class bonus. Higher goes first.
2. Each turn: one move + one action (attack, defend, cast spell, use item, hide, retreat).
3. After a player acts, turn advances. Monster turns run automatically.

### Grid
- 6x6 grid. Party spawns at row 0, monsters at rows 4-5.
- Movement: Manhattan distance.
- Adjacency/attack range: Chebyshev distance (diagonals = 1).

### Attack Roll
- **Roll:** d20 + modifier vs target AC
- **Melee modifier:** STR / 2
- **Ranged modifier:** DEX / 2
- **Target AC:** 10 (base) + armor bonus + buff AC bonus
- **Critical hit:** Natural 20. Doubles damage dice.
- **Flanking:** Attacking a target engaged with someone else gives advantage (roll twice, take better).
- **Hidden advantage:** Attacking from hidden gives advantage.

### Damage
- **Base:** 1d6 (2d6 on critical)
- **Melee bonus:** STR/2 + weapon damage
- **Ranged bonus:** DEX/2 + weapon damage
- **Minimum:** 1

### Monster AI
Monsters act automatically after player turns:
- **Sleeping:** Skip turn
- **Melee:** Move toward nearest visible player (2 cells/turn), attack if adjacent
- **Ranged:** Attack if in range, otherwise move closer
- **Targeting:** Prefer engaged target, then nearest non-hidden player

### Engagement
- Melee attacks create mutual engagement between attacker and target
- Engaged combatants provoke opportunity attacks when retreating
- Hiding breaks engagement

### Buffs
- **AC Bonus (shield, defend):** Adds to defense for N rounds
- **Sleep:** Target skips turns, damage wakes them
- Buffs tick down each round

---

## Trap Mechanics

### Detection
- On room entry, party rolls to detect each trap
- Thieves get a detection bonus
- Detected traps are revealed in the snapshot

### Triggering
- Undetected room traps trigger on the point character (first alive in formation)
- Chest traps trigger on the character who opens the chest
- Damage is applied directly to the victim

### Disarming
- Only discovered traps can be disarmed
- Roll: d20 + DEX/2 + class bonus vs trap DC
- Thieves get +6 bonus
- Failure triggers the trap on the disarmer
